        <h6>I should be a Moderator, because I have a great experience at staff, with communicating with people, helping and giving the right information to the people so they can understand better. Also I want to help the other Staff members when they are either sleep, doing other activities, doing homework, at work, moderating on another server. I also should be Helper, because I am a friendly guy who is strict with the rules and is cool with the people, who wants to give back to the community and fulfill the duty I am going to fulfill. I also want to give back by helping the other Moderator get rid of the trolls and make the community a better place for all people.







            I want you to know that I’m not applying or trying to become a moderator for power, or a name on the server. I want to help keep things in order, help players have fun, and keep the server up and running! I play quite a lot, and there aren't any staff members on when I’m on. If I were a moderator, I would be 100% dedicated to the server, and I would try my very best to be on as much as I can to help others....
